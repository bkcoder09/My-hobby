                    I love to sew because it relaxes me plus I get to make new things! Whenever I need something new that I can sew I will sew it. Sometimes I need help from my mom though because I have trouble sewing some things. Sewing is very fun for me because it is cool to make new things. I can sew pillows, sashes, drawstring bags, and simple teddies.
